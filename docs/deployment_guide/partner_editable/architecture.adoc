.Partner Solution architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/uipath-automation-suite-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two or more Availability Zones.
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
 ** A Linux bastion host to control inbound SSH (Secure Shell) access (port 22) to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in the private subnets.
 ** Bastion security group for fine-grained inbound access to the bastion host instance.
* In the private subnets:
 ** Security groups for fine-grained access to the Kubernetes server and agent nodes.
 ** An Application Load Balancer or a Network Load Balancer to balance 443 inbound traffic between all Kubernetes nodes.
 ** An Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group with Kubernetes agent nodes. Nodes are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances running Linux.
 ** An Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group with Kubernetes server nodes. Nodes are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances running Linux.
 ** An internal Network Load Balancer to balance 6443 (the Kubernetes API) and 9345 (the RKE2 registration address) traffic between the Kubernetes server nodes.
 ** A database subnet security group for Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database instances running Microsoft SQL Server.
 * Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) for storing backup data.
* AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for domain registration with an SSL certificate.
* Amazon Route 53 as Domain Name System (DNS) provider to route traffic to the Application Load Balancer.
* AWS Secrets Manager for secure storage of cluster configuration and platform-generated credentials.
* Multiple AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles granting access to various operations required during deployment and installation.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Partner Solution into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#

=== Deployment and instance type mapping

The template dynamically computes the hardware needed for the deployment as follows:

* It sets minimum requirements for a cluster.
* Depending on the deployment profile (multi-node or single-node profile), it sets minimum requirements for a single virtual machine (VM).
* Selects the instance types based on their availability in the Region you deploy and the requirements for the cluster or single VM.

The following table shows the mappings between deployment and possible instance types:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Deployment type | Instance type

| Single-node, services selection that needs less than 16 CPUs
| `+c5.4xlarge+`, `+c5a.4xlarge+`, `+m5.4xlarge+`, `+m5a.4xlarge+`

| Single-node, services selection that needs more than 16 CPUs
| `+c5a.8xlarge+`, `+c5.9xlarge+`, `+m5.8xlarge+`

| Multi-node, services selection that needs less than 48 CPUs
| `+c5.4xlarge+`, `+c5a.4xlarge+`, `+m5.4xlarge+`, `+m4.4xlarge+`

| Multi-node, services selection that needs more than 48 CPUs
| `+c5a.8xlarge+`, `+c5.9xlarge+`, `+m5.8xlarge+`, `+m5a.8xlarge+`

=== Security groups and firewalls

When Amazon EC2 instances are launched, they must be associated with a security group, which acts as a stateful firewall. You have complete control over the security group's inbound and outbound network traffic. You can build granular rules that are scoped by protocol, port number, and source/destination IP address, or other security groups. By default, all outbound traffic from security groups is permitted. Inbound traffic, however, must be configured to allow the appropriate traffic to reach your instances. You should tightly control inbound traffic to reduce the attack surface of your EC2 instances while leaving the following ports open for application communication.

{partner-product-short-name} ports:

|===
| Port | Protocol | Purpose

| 22
| TCP
| For SSH  (cluster management debugging)
