// Edit this placeholder text as necessary to describe the deployment options.

This Partner Solution provides the following deployment options:

* Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC. This option builds a new AWS environment that consists of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC. This deployment option lets you choose between two configuration approaches, depending on the number of parameters you can configure:
 ** https://fwd.aws/447zn?[Basic version^]: This option is designed to be more prescriptive in nature, as most configuration parameters are provided for you.
 ** https://fwd.aws/4E99w?[In-depth version^]: This option is designed for organizations that prefer to customize configuration parameters.
* https://fwd.aws/48DJJ?[Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC^]. This option provisions {partner-product-short-name} in your existing AWS infrastructure.

This Partner Solution provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-short-name} settings.
