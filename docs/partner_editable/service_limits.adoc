If necessary, request https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home?region=us-east-2#!/[service quota increases] for the following resources. You might need to request increases if your existing deployment currently uses these resources and if this Quick Start deployment could result in exceeding the default quotas. The https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home?region=us-east-2#!/[Service Quotas console] displays your usage and quotas for some aspects of some services.

For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html[What is Service Quotas?] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html[AWS service quotas].
