This deployment guide requires a moderate level of familiarity with AWS services. If you're new to AWS, visit the https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/[Getting Started Resource Center] and the https://aws.amazon.com/training/[AWS Training and Certification website]. These sites provide materials for learning how to design, deploy, and operate your infrastructure and applications on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start also assumes familiarity with AWS Services listed in the <<_resource_quotas,Resource quotas>> section of this guide. For a detailed diagram and description of the architecture, see <<_architecture,Deployment architecture on AWS>>.
