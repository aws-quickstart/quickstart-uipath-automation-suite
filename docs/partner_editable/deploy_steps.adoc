. Check the AWS Region displayed in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar and make sure it is the correct region you are deploying in. This Region is where the network infrastructure for Automation Suite is built. The template is launched in the `us-east-1` Region by default.
. On the *Create stack* page, keep the default setting for the template URL, and then choose *Next*.
. On the *Specify stack details* page, change the stack name if needed. Review the parameters for the template. Provide values for the parameters that require input. For all other parameters, review the default settings and customize them as necessary. For details on each parameter, see AWS deployment parameters. After reviewing and customizing the parameters, choose *Next*.
