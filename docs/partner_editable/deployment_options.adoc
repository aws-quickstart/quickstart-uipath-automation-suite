== Deployment options

This Quick Start provides the following deployment options:

* *Deploy UiPath Automation Suite into a new VPC*. This option builds a new AWS environment that consists of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. The UiPath Automation Suite is then deployed directly into this new VPC. To set up the networking and routing infrastructure, you only need to provide the CIDR block for the VPC that you want to create. This deployment option lets you choose between two configuration approaches, depending on the number of parameters you can configure:
 ** basic
 ** in-depth
* *Deploy UiPath Automation Suite into an existing VPC*. With this option, resources are provisioned into an existing AWS VPC, and Automation Suite is deployed there.
