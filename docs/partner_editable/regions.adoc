For the Quick Start to work in a Region other than its default Region, all the services that are part of the deployment must also be supported in that Region.

For an up-to-date list of AWS Regions and the AWS services they support, see https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/[AWS Regional Services].

NOTE:  Certain Regions are available on an opt-in basis. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html[Managing AWS Regions].

To test whether a specific Region is supported, you can launch Quick Start for that Region and, if you get an `Unrecognized resource type` error, then Quick Start is not supported in that Region.
